# Othello

## Rules

Othello is a game of strategy played between two players on an 8x8 board. The game is played with black and white pieces. The goal of the game is to have the majority of pieces on the board at the end of the game. The game is played by placing pieces on the board, and then flipping the pieces of the opponent that are in between the placed piece and another piece of the same color. The game ends when neither player can place a piece on the board.
